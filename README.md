ExcelVBA
===========

This is a library of vba modules and functions I use in my Excel projects as well as modules I've submitted to various forums. 

Note the ".vb" is placed at the end of each filename to allow git to recognize the script type. You don't need these in your project. Typically, I'll copy the raw output to my module in Excel VBA so the name on Git is irrelevant. Enjoy!
